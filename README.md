# Advent of Code 2023

Going to use Go for 2023's AoC, haven't used it in a while and want to get back into it.

Aiming for readable and "reasonable" - in the true sense of the word - solutions, not the most efficient or brainiest. In this vain I will allow myself the one luxury to extract the code for reading the lines in the inputs.
